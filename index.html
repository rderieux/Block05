    <!--Description of bears-->
    <p>
      Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae (/ˈɜːrsɪdiː, -daɪ/).
      They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only
      eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a
      wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and
      partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of
      North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of
      modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small
      rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws,
      and short tails.

      The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
      Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
      ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one
      species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently,
      researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new
      research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species
      can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Seven other extinct
      species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

    <!--Description of lions-->
    <p>
      The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to
      Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded
      head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is
      sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
      prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A
      lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
      Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
      medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone
      predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have
      been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
      prey on humans.

    <!--Description of monkeys with their image-->
    <p>
      Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder
      Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the
      group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus
      monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping;
      however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are
      also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to
      their scope.

    <!--Description of alligators with their image-->
    <p>
      An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the genus
      Alligator of the family Alligatoridae of the order Crocodilia. The two
      extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the
      Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). Additionally, several extinct species of
      alligator are known from fossil remains. Alligators first appeared during
      the late Eocene epoch about 37 million years ago.
